# CountdownWordFinder
Returns a list of words that range from 5 - 9 letters long based on the 9 letters passed in

## Why?
If you're like me, you've probably watched an episode of Countdown, seen the contestants pulling 7-9 letter words out of the mess of letters that appear on screen and wondered "*Why can't I do that?*". Well no longer.

This program does all the hard work for you, so whilst everyone else is racking their brains around the problem before them, you can sit back and gloat.

## How to use
It's a simple console application that only requires the 9 letters that appear during the letters round, separated by a space (caps shouldn't matter).

The output from which will be a bit of a mess (I'll clean this up eventually), but will contain the 5-9 letter words for the given input.
